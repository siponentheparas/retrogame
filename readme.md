## About
This is a school assingment to create a hall of fame and admin panel for https://retrogamehouse.fi \
I don't want to use any libraries or frameworks on the frontend. I want to keep it html + css + javascript, no react or other helping stuff.
I like doing things the hard way.



## Run
`npm i` to install packages

`node src/index.js` to run the project

This project does not use a database, it keeps data in memory and stores/loads it from disk.\
When you send SIGINT or SIGTERM it saves data to disk.

## Project structure
- html: frontend website
- src: backend to be used on a server
